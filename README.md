# dfs_sudoku

Created an interactive sudoku game with pygame and implemented a depth first search algorithm to solve a sudoku puzzle.

sudokuAlgo.py contains functions used to implement a recursive depth first search with backtracking.
gui.py contains classes and methods to draw images and handle events like mouse clicking and keyboard pressing.
board.py initializes unsolved sudoku matrices to be used in the game.

Images of different states of the game provided in the repository.
